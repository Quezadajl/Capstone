### Data Sources
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics developed new data on how U.S. businesses changed their operations and employment since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. 

The BRS asked questions in three areas:

1) business experiences and payroll decisions, 

2) worker benefits and their ability to telework, and 

3) whether a business received a loan or grant from the government tied to the payroll.

Results from the Business Response Survey across the private sector, in combination with data collected by other current BLS surveys, 
will aid in understanding how employment has swifted across industries along with how businesses responded to government-mandated closures during the start pandemic.
